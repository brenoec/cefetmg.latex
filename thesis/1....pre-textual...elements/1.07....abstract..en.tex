\begin{resumo}[Abstract]
    Software development, maintenance and evolution activities are highly
	complex, since issues pertinent to their practice range from techniques and
	technologies to sociocultural.
	In order to properly change a software system, it is necessary to understand
	the application domain, the technical and technological aspects involved, as
	well as the system itself.
	In this regard, we propose a model for running software analysis through
	hierarchical, heterogeneous and navigable networks at multiple scales, with
	links and topological components.
	As certain properties of software systems are only known during their
	execution, the model is for the most part constructed from execution traces 
	reduced in space and time.
	Static analysis techniques can be used to complement it.
	The result of the application of the model in systems under analysis is a
	map of its execution structure.
	We conducted a case study on application \texttt{gulp}, a JavaScript
	\textit{task runner}.
	Preliminary results indicate the need to analyze software as a system of
	systems.

	Complex Software Networks.

	Force-oriented graph drawing.
	Hybrid Software Analysis.
	Software Visualization.
